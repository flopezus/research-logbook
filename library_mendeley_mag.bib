These fields accelerate deuterons, which produce neutrons. The total current I/sub 0/ is assumed to be constant but to consist of two components: I/sub 0/ = I/sub 1/+I/sub 2/, where K/sub 1/(t) is a decaying current in the main pinch, and I/sub 2/(t) is an increasing current in the peripheral plasma around the pinch. The current I/sub 1/ produces fields B = 2I/sub 1//cr and E = I/sub 1/c/sup -2/ ln(r/R)/sup 2/, where R is some length. The current I/sub 1/ is assumed to fall off so rapidly that the deuterons of the peripheral plasma are not ''coiled'' by the magnetic field. They acquire a velocity v = (e/M) ..integral..

   abstract = {During the early investigation of the high-energy, low-pressure mode of a coaxial hydromagnetic gun, a second mode of action was established for large gas fillings. This particular mode, previously reported was found to lead to a high-density plasma focus situated at a distance ∼1-1.5 cm beyond the face of the center electrode. The plasma focus has the following properties; particle density ρ ∼ 2-3 × 1019/cm3, temperature T ∼ 1-3 keV, time duration t ∼ 0.2-0.3 μsec, and volume ∼15 mm 3. Neutron yields >1010/burst and soft x rays are observed. These results are remarkably similar to those reported by Petrov et al. and Filippov et al. of the USSR using a metal wall pinch tube apparatus. The average velocity vz of the current sheath in the gun proper is found to depend on the fourth root of the applied voltage squares, divided by the mass density according to the simple "snowplow" "M" theory. The current sheath is found to be nonplanar and mass pickup by the advancing sheath is nonlinear with radius. The sudden collapse of the radial current sheath toward the axis at the center electrode end is most likely caused by the rapid conversion of stored magnetic energy into radial sheath motion (v̄r ∼ 3.5 × 107 cm/sec) forming in essence a super dense pinch effect.},

   abstract = {In a low energy (2.3 kJ) Mather-type deuterium plasma focus, neutron and charged particle emission is investigated by using time-resolved neutron detectors and time-integrated charged particle pinhole imaging camera. The time-integrated charged particle pinhole images demonstrate the varying influence of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities vis-a-vis filling pressure. The neutron production mechanism at play strongly depends upon the pressure. At lower pressure, the plasma column is highly unstable due to MHD instabilities and the neutron emission is found to be low with fluence anisotropy exceeding 3.5. At optimum pressure (2.5 mbar for this system), an almost stable dense plasma of about 17 mm3 volume is formed about 5 mm away from the anode, with neutron emission at its highest and the fluence anisotropy lowest. At higher pressure, the plasma column is stable, although it moves away from the anode like a jet and may then be called a moving boiler. In this case, the neutron emission is lowered compared to its optimum value and fluence anisotropy is increased. The data suggest beam-target mechanism at low pressure, trapped gyrating particles at optimum pressure and a jetlike moving boiler at higher pressure. © 1999 American Institute of Physics.},

   abstract = {It is well known both in early Z-pinch experiments and more recently in plasma focus experiments that highly accelerated ion beams are formed, this being inferred from the axial centre-of-mass motion of the neutrons produced by nuclear reactions. Two acceleration mechanisms are discussed here. The first, proposed in ref. 1, concerns the acceleration of ions across an electrostatic sheath adjacent to the anode, this sheath having a thickness less than an ion Larmor radius but greater than an electron Larmor radius. The electrons in the sheath, being magnetised, have acE ×B/B 2 drift through which the JrBo force is provided to satisfy momentum conservation. The second is a new mechanism arising from the occurrence of a violent m = 0 instability, and relies on large ion Larmor radius effects. It is shown that the inclusion of the Hall terms and finite ion Larmor radius (FLR) terms in the MHD equations removes the mirror symmetry each side of an m = 0 neck. A detailed consideration of particle orbits during the formation of the highly compressed neck shows that on the cathode side of the neck an energetic ion beam is formed close to the axis, whilst on the anode side an equal and opposite momentum is distributed among a larger number of ions throughout the cross-section.},

@inproceedings{Zhang2006,
   abstract = {The operating conditions of the plasma focus depend strongly on several macroscopic parameters like energy of cap bank, current, voltage, electrodes dimension, and curvature of current sheath in axial phase. The drive parameter () ρ a I p which is proportional to the speed of the plasma in both axial and radial phases is one of the most important parameter which determines the performance of a DPF as a source of fusion neutron. Experiments on 2-3 kJ DPF have been done to show that this parameter is important over a wide range of other parameters like anode length, insulator sleeve length and operating gas pressures. The NX2 machine was modified to have different aspect ratios ranging from A=L/2a ≈0.2 (NX2-F) to 1.52 (NX2). Here 2a, the diameter of the anode is taken from the flat top of the anode and L is taken as the free length of the anode, i.e. between the tip of anode to the insulator sleeve. In the case of neutron yield the speed is critical as the highest temperature ~1keV needs to be achieved as the cross section for reaction is strongly dependent on temperature. A compromise between high speed which implies high temperature and low speeds which implies longer confinement time gives the optimum yield for drive parameter 89kA/cm/Torr 1/2 for Mather type focus and a drive parameter of 50kA/cm/Torr 1/2 for Filippov type focus. The NX2-F with its mushroom shaped anode has a drive parameter intermediate between the Filippov and Mather type plasma focus is due to the shape intermediate between the Filippov and Mather type plasma focus devices. The drive parameter for NX2-F is found to keep constant at different voltages. In addition, neutron yields from the modified plasma focus tube without original cathode rods were also found to have the same order magnitude as the original electrode systems and reach the highest at the same gas pressure. This confirms that the drive parameter has an importance over cathodes at a big range of gas pressures. ________________________________ * Work supported by the AcRF grant RI 17/03/RSR from NIE, Singapore.},

This paper points out that Mather-type plasma focus devices operated in the neutron-optimized regime have remarkably little variation in a drive parameter, (Ip/a)/pt", the peak drive current per unit anode radius divided by the square root of the fill density; this quantity having the value of 89 W c m per torr deuterium equivalent of fill gas with a standard deviation of less than 10%. This parameter controls the speed of the plasma in both the axial and radial phases; and its constancy over a wide range of plasma focus devices really indicates that these devices all operate at the same axial and radial speeds, and hence by inference they all have the same temperatures in the axial and radial phases. Using a simple dynamical model the linear dimensions and time scales of the gross plasma focus pinch are shown to be related to the anode radius of the plasma focus device. The results of experiments performed with a 3-kJ device using different anodes are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions.},

Solid-state nuclear track detectors (PM-355) were used in the focal plane of the spectrometer to detect the analysed ions, with multiple spectra being recorded on each detector. An automated track counting system has been developed to read the spectral information from the detectors, which has facilitated the analysis of a far greater number of energy spectra, with greater accuracy, than has been possible in previous work. This automated system comprises an optical microscope with CCD camera, a motorized microscope stage, and image processing and control software. The experimental results show that the deuterons emitted from the pinch region have a continuous spectrum of energies which follow the empirical relationship dN/dE ∝ E −n , where n is typically in the range 6-7. A clear correlation between the measured deuteron energy spectra and neutron flux is observed at each of three working gas pressures investigated.},

The average energy of the D-D neutrons emitted along the axis was shifted ∼500 keV corresponding to an axial center-of-mass velocity of 2 × 108 cm/sec for the reacting deuterons. An 11% anisotropy in the neutron fluxes measured in the forward and radial directions correlates with an axially streaming plasma which is not isotropic; the reacting deuterons collide predominantly in the radial direction. Time-resolved collimation measurements of the emitted neutrons showed an axial translation of the neutron source corresponding to velocities up to 2 × 108 cm/sec; this correlates with the nonsimultaneous pinching of the noncylindrical plasma along the axis. Plasma densities of ∼ 2 × 1020 cm-3 and ion temperatures of 2 keV were consistent with observed neutron yields of 1010 and pulse widths of 60 nsec. X-ray intensity measurements were made for x-ray energies of 7 < E p < 30 keV and showed an Ep-2 dependence which does not agree with plasma bremsstrahlung, but appears to result from anode bombardment of axially accelerated electrons with energies > 200 keV.

   abstract = {Zirconium and beryllium fast-neutron activation detectors are used to investigate the fusion neutron emission from the NX3 Plasma Focus (PF) device operated in deuterium gas, with 7.2 kJ bank energy. Both Zr and Be activation cross-sections increase with energy, but with different trends, enabling an effective neutron energy Eneff to be inferred from the Zr/Be count ratio. The relationship between Eneff and Zr/Be count ratio is established by MCNP5 simulation. Compact Zr/Be detector pairs were positioned at 0° and 90° to the PF axis, permitting measurements of neutron yield, energy- and fluence-anisotropy to be made for each shot. Series of NX3 shots were performed for D2 gas pressures ranging from 1.5 to 10 mbar. Typical effective neutron energies Eneff for the 0° and 90° directions are found to be ∼2.8 MeV and ∼2.5 MeV, respectively. The highest neutron yields of ∼109 neutron/shot were observed for 5 mbar D2 gas pressure. Neutron fluence-anisotropy AnBe for individual shots ranged from ∼2.5 to ∼4.5. The mean value AnBe exhibits a steady decline with increasing D2 gas pressure. By contrast, neutron energy-anisotropy ΔEn remains almost constant as the D2 gas pressure is varied. The effect of blocking the forward D+ ion beam with an obstacle plate positioned 6 cm in front of the anode tip is also studied. Marked reductions in both neutron yield and fluence-anisotropy are observed, whilst the effective neutron energy Eneff increases slightly at both 0° and 90° directions. Fusion contributions from thermonuclear or gyrating-particle processes are found to be negligible. All results are completely consistent with a straightforward beam–target model of PF fusion.},

   abstract = {A spectrum unfolding technique GAMCD (Genetic Algorithm and Monte Carlo based spectrum Deconvolution) has been developed using the genetic algorithm methodology within the framework of Monte Carlo simulations. Each Monte Carlo history starts with initial solution vectors (population) as randomly generated points in the hyper dimensional solution space that are related to the measured data by the response matrix of the detection system. The transition of the solution points in the solution space from one generation to another are governed by the genetic algorithm methodology using the techniques of cross-over (mating) and mutation in a probabilistic manner adding new solution points to the population. The population size is kept constant by discarding solutions having lesser fitness values (larger differences between measured and calculated results). Solutions having the highest fitness value at the end of each Monte Carlo history are averaged over all histories to obtain the final spectral solution. The present method shows promising results in neutron spectrum unfolding for both under-determined and over-determined problems with simulated test data as well as measured data when compared with some existing unfolding codes. An attractive advantage of the present method is the independence of the final spectra from the initial guess spectra. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

For this purpose we used a novel approach based on the combination of the information obtained with six large high-pressure 3He proportional counters embedded in individual polyethylene blocks of different size. In this way not only the integral value but also the flux distribution as a function of neutron energy was determined in the range from 1 eV to 10 MeV.

The high sensitivity of the setup allowed to measure a neutron flux level which is about four orders of magnitude smaller that the neutron background at sea level.

   abstract = {This paper introduces a methodology for the yield measurement of a neutron burst using neutron proportional counters. This methodology is to be applied when single neutron events cannot be resolved in time by nuclear standard electronics, or when a continuous current cannot be measured at the output of the counter. The methodology is based on the calibration of the counter in pulse mode, and the use of a statistical model to estimate the number of detected events from the accumulated charge resulting from the detection of the burst of neutrons. The model is developed and presented in full detail. For the measurement of fast neutron yields generated from plasma focus experiments using a moderated proportional counter, the implementation of the methodology is herein discussed. An experimental verification of the accuracy of the methodology is presented. An improvement of more than one order of magnitude in the accuracy of the detection system is obtained by using this methodology with respect to previous calibration methods. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

   abstract = {Ambient neutrons may cause significant background for underground experiments. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate their flux and energy spectrum in order to devise a proper shielding. Here, two sets of altogether ten moderated He3 neutron counters are used for a detailed study of the ambient neutron background in tunnel IV of the Felsenkeller facility, underground below 45 m of rock in Dresden/Germany. One of the moderators is lined with lead and thus sensitive to neutrons of energies higher than 10 MeV. For each He3 counter moderator assembly, the energy-dependent neutron sensitivity was calculated with the FLUKA code. The count rates of the ten detectors were then fitted with the MAXED and GRAVEL packages. As a result, both the neutron energy spectrum from 10-9 to 300 MeV and the flux integrated over the same energy range were determined experimentally. The data show that at a given depth, both the flux and the spectrum vary significantly depending on local conditions. Energy-integrated fluxes of (0.61±0.05), (1.96±0.15), and (4.6±0.4)×10-4 cm-2 s-1, respectively, are measured for three sites within Felsenkeller tunnel IV which have similar muon flux but different shielding wall configurations. The integrated neutron flux data and the obtained spectra for the three sites are matched reasonably well by FLUKA Monte Carlo calculations that are based on the known muon flux and composition of the measurement room walls.},

Online wide-range neutron spectrum unfolding technology still requires improvement in accuracy and efficiency. In the work, a “two-step” neutron spectrum unfolding method based on artificial neural network (ANN) was developed to unfold spectrum with wide energy range. First, a default spectrum was reconstructed by using the ANN model which had been trained with a large amount of neutron spectra generated from Monte Carlo transport calculation. Second, the default spectrum was optimized by using iteration algorithm. The two-step method was verified with a thermal neutron reactor VENUS-3 and a fast neutron reactor BN-600. Comparison of mean square error (MSE) between this method and the traditional unfolding method showed reduction of 83.4% and 85.6% on VENUS-3 and BN-600 respectively, and average relative deviation (ARD) reduction of 89.3% and 86.1% respectively. Also, comparison of spectrum quality (Qs) showed reduction of 83.4% and 86.0% respectively for the two cases. This work demonstrated that the developed two-step method could obtain the better accuracy than traditional method.},

The unfolding is processed as a determined problem without any prior information, which is different from the traditional way. Comparison study of the two commonly-used unfolding methods, GRAVEL and MLEM with the iterative regularization method is carried out. The “semi-convergence” behavior appears for readings containing large uncertainties with the GRAVEL and MLEM methods, making the unfolded spectrums deviate from the true solutions. However, there is no semi-convergence behavior appearing with the iterative regularization method. The unfolded spectrums get close to the true solution as the number of iterations grows. Experimental measurement is carried out for measuring neutron spectrum of 241 Am–Be neutron source using the compact multi-sphere spectrometer. The measured data are also unfolded. Compared with the ISO reference spectrum, the unfolded results with GRAVEL and MLEM methods deviate from the reference spectrum due to the semi-convergence behavior, while the unfolded spectrum with the iterative regularization method agrees well with the reference spectrum, indicating that the iterative regularization method is adaptable to unfolding problems with both accurate measured readings and measured readings with large uncertainties.},

The orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm and the K-SVD algorithm are applied for sparse coding and dictionary update. The SL0 algorithm is used for reconstruction. Computational experiment is carried out, in which 5 types of the neutron spectrum are tested, including the D–T fusion neutron spectrum, Watt fission spectrum, Maxwell fission spectrum, the evaporation spectrum and 241 Am-Be neutron spectrum taken from ISO standard 8529-1. The computational experiment reveals that: firstly, with appropriate sparse representation, neutron spectrum can be unfolded with high accuracy; secondly, the unfolding method based on CS is very suitable for solving the highly under determined problem. For instance, neutron spectrum with 300 energy groups is unfolded with 7 equations.},

These results show that a significant number of ions can be accelerated to energies of up to 600 keV and that they have a large value for their time-averaged axial velocities. The orbiting motion in the magnetic field produces an anisotropic distribution of collision velocities and a neutron-production model based upon nuclear collisions by these deuterons can account for the measured characteristics of neutron energies, neutron fluxes, and rates of production.},

A detector array is used to measure simultaneously the ion beams at five different angular directions with respect to the PF axis (0°, 10°, 15°, 20° and 90°), at a distance of 77 cm from the ion source. Ion beam energy correlations for operation in methane indicate that the dominant charge states on the detector are H+, C+4 and C+5, irrespective of the angular positions. The time integrated ion beam signal and the energy-dispersive x-ray analysis of a carbon films deposited on silicon surface shows the impurity emission from the PF electrode surface. Measured ion fluxes are maximum for the energy range of 15-40 keV, 50-100 keV and 100-300 keV, for H+, C+4, and C+5, respectively. Measurements of the angular distribution of hydrogen and carbon ions reveal a strong angular anisotropy. It is argued that the observed angular anisotropy of the ion beam emission can be explained in terms of ion Larmor radius effects during the z-pinch like plasma formation phase, which is characteristic of PF discharges. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Its focus is on understanding the principal defining characteristic features of the plasma focus in the light of the developments that have taken place in the last 20 years, in terms of new facilities, diagnostics, models, and insights. Although it is too soon to proclaim with certainty what the plasma focus phenomenon is, the results available to date conclusively indicate what it is demonstrably not. The review looks at the experimental data, cross-correlated across multiple diagnostics and multiple devices, to delineate the contours of an emerging narrative that is fascinatingly different from the standard narrative, which has guided the consensus in the plasma focus community for several decades, without invalidating it. It raises a question mark over the Fundamental Premise of Controlled Fusion Research, namely, that any fusion reaction having the character of a beam-target process must necessarily be more inefficient than a thermonuclear process with a confined thermal plasma at a suitably high temperature. Open questions that need attention of researchers are highlighted. A future course of action is suggested that individual plasma focus laboratories could adopt in order to positively influence the future growth of research in this field, to the general benefit of not only the controlled fusion research community but also the world at large.},

Similarities and differences in plasma focus devices working with stored energies ranging from 1 MJ to 0.1 J are found. First, a brief review listing the most important results achieved by the Thermonuclear Plasma Department of the Chilean Nuclear Energy Commission, CCHEN, is presented. The aim of the work at CCHEN has been to characterize the physics of dense plasma foci and also to carry out the design and construction of smaller devices-in terms of both input energy and size-capable of providing dense hot plasmas. Certain scaling rules have been found from this research. These rules combined with other scaling laws have been applied to design and construct plasma focus devices with storage energy in a region never explored before (tens of joules and less than 1 J). Thus, a comprehensive analysis also including results from other groups is presented. In particular, all the devices, from the largest to the smallest, maintain the same value of ion density, magnetic field, plasma sheath velocity, Alfvén speed and the quantity of energy per particle. Therefore, fusion reactions are even possible to obtain in ultraminiature devices (driven by generators of 0.1 J for example), as they are in the larger devices (driven by generators of 1 MJ). However, the stability of the plasma pinch highly depends on the size and energy of the device. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

A breakthrough is reported in this study, by mega-size position-sensitive polycarbonate ion image detection systems invented, on discovery of 4π ion emission from the "anode top" in a PFD space after plasma pinch instability and radial run-away of ions from the "anode cathodes array" during axial acceleration of plasma sheaths before the radial phase. These two ion emission source mechanisms behave respectively as a "Point Ion Source" and a "Line Ion Source" forming "Ion Cathode Shadows" on mega-size detectors.

We show that when this population takes the form of a power-law at high energies, specific changes occur to the spectrum which are diagnosable. In particular, the usual Gaussian spectral shape produced by a thermal plasma is replaced by a Lorentz-like spectrum with broad wings extending far from the spectral peak. Additionally, it is found that the full width at half maximum of the spectrum depends on both the ion temperature and the power-law exponent. This causes the use of the spectral width for determination of the ion temperature to be unreliable. We show that these changes are distinguishable from other broadening mechanisms, such as temporal and motional broadening, and that detailed fitting of the spectral shape is a promising method for extracting information about the state of the ions. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

This has applications to inertial confinement fusion. Several hohlraum designs have been tested. The vacuum hohlraum has demonstrated the control of symmetry of irradiation on a capsule, while the dynamic hohlraum at a higher radiation temperature of 230 eV has compressed a capsule from 2 mm to 0.8 mm diameter with a neutron yield >3 × 1011 thermal DD neutrons, a record for any capsule implosion. World record ion temperatures of >200 keV have recently been measured in a stainless-steel plasma designed for Kα emission at stagnation, due, it was predicted, to ion-viscous heating associated with the dissipation of fast-growing short wavelength nonlinear MHD instabilities. Direct fusion experiments using deuterium gas-puffs have yielded 3.9 × 10 13 neutrons with only 5% asymmetry, suggesting for the first time a mainly thermal source. The physics of wire-array implosions is a dominant theme. It is concerned with the transformation of wires to liquid-vapour expanding cores; then the generation of a surrounding plasma corona which carries most of the current, with inward flowing low magnetic Reynolds number jets correlated with axial instabilities on each wire; later an almost constant velocity, snowplough-like implosion occurs during which gaps appear in the cores, leading to stagnation on the axis, and the production of the main soft-x-ray pulse. These studies have been pursued also with smaller facilities in other laboratories around the world. At Imperial College, conical and radial wire arrays have led to highly collimated tungsten plasma jets with a Mach number of >20, allowing laboratory astrophysics experiments to be undertaken. These highlights will be underpinned in this review with the basic physics of Z-pinches including stability, kinetic effects, and finally its applications. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

A generalized beam-target model is assumed where (1) high-energy deuterons have angular distributions consistent with a crossed-field acceleration mechanism, and (2) these energetic deuterons undergo fusion collisions primarily with stationary target ions. Energy distributions of ions proportional to Ed-3 in the range from 50 to as high as 600 keV give computed results agreeing with many experimental observations at laboratory angles of 0°, 90°, and 180°.

   abstract = {The energy spectrum of neutrons emitted by a range of deuterium and deuterium-tritium Z-pinch devices is investigated computationally using a hybrid kinetic-MHD model. 3D MHD simulations are used to model the implosion, stagnation, and break-up of dense plasma focus devices at currents of 70kA, 500kA, and 2 MA and also a 15 MA gas puff. Instabilities in the MHD simulations generate large electric and magnetic fields, which accelerate ions during the stagnation and break-up phases. A kinetic model is used to calculate the trajectories of these ions and the neutron spectra produced due to the interaction of these ions with the background plasma. It is found that these beam-target neutron spectra are sensitive to the electric and magnetic fields at stagnation resulting in significant differences in the spectra emitted by each device. Most notably, magnetization of the accelerated ions causes the beam-target spectra to be isotropic for the gas puff simulations. It is also shown that beam-target spectra can have a peak intensity located at a lower energy than the peak intensity of a thermonuclear spectrum. A number of other differences in the shapes of beam-target and thermonuclear spectra are also observed for each device. Finally, significant differences between the shapes of beam-target DD and DT neutron spectra, due to differences in the reaction cross-sections, are illustrated.},

We provide a method for calculating the shape of this production spectrum for arbitrary plasma distribution functions. The method is exact and can be used for both isotropic and anisotropic distributions. We derive expressions for Maxwellian (both stationary and moving with a bulk fluid velocity), bi-Maxwellian and beam-target plasmas. The neutron spectrum produced by the D + D → He3 + n reaction is studied as an example. It is shown that the neutron spectrum produced from a Maxwellian plasma becomes asymmetric at high plasma temperatures with a long high-energy tail. The effect of bulk fluid velocity on the neutron spectrum is shown to be significant in some cases. In particular, the spectrum produced by an imploding shell has a much greater FWHM than the spectrum obtained from a stationary plasma. The spectrum produced by a beam-target interaction shows significant anisotropy in the high-energy tail as the viewing angle varies from perpendicular to parallel to the beam direction. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

For six proportional counters surveyed in a low-background environment, we demonstrate the ability to reject alpha-particle events with an efficiency of 99%. By applying the same method, we also show an effective rejection of microdischarge noise events that, when passed through a shaping amplifier, are indistinguishable from physical events in the counters.

This methodology is to be applied when single neutron events cannot be resolved in time by nuclear standard electronics, or when a continuous current cannot be measured at the output of the counter. The methodology is based on the calibration of the counter in pulse mode, and the use of a statistical model to estimate the number of detected events from the accumulated charge resulting from the detection of the burst of neutrons. The model is developed and presented in full detail. For the measurement of fast neutron yields generated from plasma focus experiments using a moderated proportional counter, the implementation of the methodology is herein discussed. An experimental verification of the accuracy of the methodology is presented. An improvement of more than one order of magnitude in the accuracy of the detection system is obtained by using this methodology with respect to previous calibration methods. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

Secondary particles including neutrons are created as the proton beam interacts with beam shaping devices in the treatment head. Stray neutron exposure to the whole body may increase the risk that the patient develops a radiogenic cancer years or decades after radiotherapy. We simulated a passive proton beam delivery system with double scattering technology to determine the neutron production and energy distribution at 200 MeV proton energy. Specifically, we studied the neutron absorbed dose per therapeutic absorbed dose, the neutron absorbed dose per source particle and the neutron energy spectrum at various locations around the nozzle. We also investigated the neutron production along the nozzle's central axis. The absorbed doses and neutron spectra were simulated with the MCNPX Monte Carlo code. The simulations revealed that the range modulation wheel (RMW) is the most intense neutron source of any of the beam spreading devices within the nozzle. This finding suggests that it may be helpful to refine the design of the RMW assembly, e.g., by adding local shielding, to suppress neutron-induced damage to components in the nozzle and to reduce the shielding thickness of the treatment vault. The simulations also revealed that the neutron dose to the patient is predominated by neutrons produced in the field defining collimator assembly, located just upstream of the patient. © 2009 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.},

Temporal measurements of neutron and hard x-ray emission are studied using different arrangements of six scintillator-photomultiplier detector systems, located either radially or axially with respect to the focus symmetry axis. The axial-to-radial ratio of both total neutron yield and neutron energies indicates anisotropic emission, which is consistent with a 100 keV kinetic energy of the deuterons in the axial direction. The energy spread among different shots was ∼0.5 MeV in the axial direction which is 2.5 times the spread in the radial direction. Furthermore, temporal differences on hard x-rays and neutron production over each direction are found. These differences show correlation with neutron energies. This could be related to the existence of two temporally separated neutron production times corresponding to different moments during the plasma focus discharge.},
